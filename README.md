# Artistic-Style-Image-Neural-Net
This program takes two images ( one for content, one for the style ), and combines the two, in a way that you have a features from both images.

In this case, the picture used for content was a picture of myself

<img src = "baseImage.jpg" width = 512 height = 512>

And the style picture, was a famous art, called Starry Night, by Vincent Van Gogh

<img src = "style.jpg" width = 512>

And the combined result was

<img src = "funny.png" width = 512>
